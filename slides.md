SVG is a awesome vector image format. Its xml, just like html. Its embbedable inside `<img>` tags, and can be put inline inside of your HTML.

```html
<!doctype html>
<title>My Sweet HTML Page</title>
<meta charset='utf8' />
<svg
  xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'
  version='1.1'
  width='10px'
  height='10px'
  viewBox='0 0 10 10'
>
  <circle cx='5' cy='5' r='5' fill='tomato'/>
</svg>
```

Its pretty much part of the modern html.
